Introduction</h2>
<p>The goal of this library is to bring USB connectivity to the AVR XMEGA series of micrcontrollers by utilizing the Maxim MAX3420E USB Peripheral Controller with SPI Interface. The library could also be easily adapted to work with a different AVR processor and perhaps different USB hardware since modularity was a major goal during coding.<br/>
 At this point the library supports the USB Mass Storage Class, implementing a SCSI compliant LBA device utilizing an external flash memory.<br/>
 Future plans include adding other USB device capabilities such as a Communications Device Class and Human Interface Device Class support.<br/>
 The library has been tested on a prototype device which acts as a portable data logger and uses the USB interface to make logged data available to a PC.<br/>
</p>

Software</h2>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="module-overview"></a>
Module Overview</h3>
<p>The library is divided into several modules:</p>
<ul>
<li>MAX3420E Interface and Communications Code (<a class="el" href="max-3420_8h.html">max-3420.h</a>, <a class="el" href="max-3420_8c.html">max-3420.c</a>)</li>
<li>USB Mass Storage Class (<a class="el" href="usb-mass-storage_8h.html">usb-mass-storage.h</a>, <a class="el" href="usb-mass-storage_8c.html">usb-mass-storage.c</a>)</li>
<li>SCSI Command Library (<a class="el" href="scsi-commands_8h.html">scsi-commands.h</a>, <a class="el" href="scsi-commands_8c.html">scsi-commands.c</a>)</li>
<li>Flash Memory Library (<a class="el" href="spi-flash-memory_8h.html">spi-flash-memory.h</a>, <a class="el" href="spi-flash-memory_8c.html">spi-flash-memory.c</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="max3420"></a>
MAX3420E Interface and Communications Code</h3>
<p>The max-3420 source code includes functions for basic communication with the '3420, including initialization, USB connection, USB termination, and USB reset. It also includes functions for reading and writing the USB endpoints which the '3420 provides.<br/>
 Most importantly, the library provides the <a class="el" href="max-3420_8c.html#a057d096ed96855d0dfbdeca53892e961">getUsbEvent()</a> function which forms the basis of the "event loop" for USB connectivity. Basically <a class="el" href="max-3420_8c.html#a057d096ed96855d0dfbdeca53892e961">getUsbEvent()</a> waits for certain events such as USB reset, setup packet, or data available on an endpoint. The function then returns the event type, and the higher level USB library then handles the event using the utility and communications functions also provided by the library.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="usb-mass-storage"></a>
USB Mass Storage Class</h3>
<p>The USB Mass Storage Class library provides the functions for basic functionality of a USB mass storage device. This includes standard device and configuration descriptors; functions to handle standard USB device, interface, and endpoint requests; functions to handle bulk data transfers, and miscellaneous other details.<br/>
 The central functions in this library are <a class="el" href="usb-mass-storage_8c.html#a4288d3c4ba7d7fc0f03834509fd8eca2">processSetupPacket()</a>, <a class="el" href="usb-mass-storage_8c.html#a88f63f387f5762fa1b3451333fe5b1ed">writeBulkIn()</a>, and <a class="el" href="usb-mass-storage_8c.html#aa0e6308e5a7ebb3b6cc80cae9d574ddb">readBulkOut()</a>. <a class="el" href="usb-mass-storage_8c.html#a4288d3c4ba7d7fc0f03834509fd8eca2">processSetupPacket()</a> is used to respond to a USB setup packet and thereby processes standard requests over the control pipe.<br/>
 <a class="el" href="usb-mass-storage_8c.html#a88f63f387f5762fa1b3451333fe5b1ed">writeBulkIn()</a> and <a class="el" href="usb-mass-storage_8c.html#aa0e6308e5a7ebb3b6cc80cae9d574ddb">readBulkOut()</a> are provided to send and receive data over the bulk transfer pipes which are part of any Mass Storage Class device. These functions not only act as a way to send data, but also make sure amount of data sent or received complies with amount specified in bulk CDB.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="scsi-commands"></a>
SCSI Command Library</h3>
<p>The SCSI Command Library provides a way to decode and execute SCSI commands sent by the USB host in the bulk transfer CB. These commands are what provide the low level interface to the data storage media for a Mass Storage Device.<br/>
 The most important function in this library is <a class="el" href="scsi-commands_8c.html#ad8b615a672753a92102ba60722cc93b8">processScsiCommand()</a> which is called by the USB Mass Storage library once a CBW has been received over the bulk transfer pipe.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="spi-flash-memory"></a>
Flash Memory Library</h3>
<p>The flash memory library provides basic data read/write/erase functionality. For this particular library, the flash memory is connected via SPI. The protocol is built for the Atmel AT26 series memories, although it could be adapted to work with other devices.<br/>
 This library is utilized by the SCSI library for actually reading/writing to flash memory.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="v-bus"></a>
USB Vbus Detection</h3>
<p>The entire library relies on a function to detect when +5V is present on the USB bus called vBusHi().<br/>
 This function must be provided by external code, since there are numerous ways to implement this. vBusHi() is expected to return 1 if Vbus is present, and 0 otherwise.<br/>
 Obviously in a bus powered application this sort of detection is unimportant, so in this case a simple macro will suffice: </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment"><span class="preprocessor"> #define vBusHi()  1</span>
</pre></div><p> <br/>
 However, in a self powered application things get more complicated. See USB_SUSPEND and "MAX3420E Programming Guide" HOSCSTEN programming notes for more details.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="delay-loops"></a>
Delay Loops</h3>
<p>In a few instances there are small delay loops in the code which reduce unnecessary SPI bus traffic when waiting for events such as MAX3420 oscillator stabilization and AT26 erase progress. At the moment, these delay loops are implemented using the avr-libc _delay_ms() and _delay_us() functions.</p>
<p>A problem arises when using these functions with numerous cpu clock frequencies which change at runtime. Since the functions rely on a compile time constant for clock frequency, changing this clock frequency on the fly changes the delay which these functions cause. In the reference design, F_CPU is defined as 2000000 (2 MHz), but the activation of the USB link causes CPU frequency to be changed to 32MHz. Thus, the delay loops are off by a factor of 16 if this frequency change is not compensated for. This is why the following can be found in the code:<br/>
 </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment"> _delay_ms(160.0);               <span class="comment">// delay 10ms </span>
</pre></div><p> The actual delay is 10ms; The delay loop is calibrated for 2MHz CPU frequency, but the CPU frequency in this block of code is actually 32 MHz. Therefore the delay is increased 16x to produce the proper delay.</p>
<p><b>These delay loop calls should be updated to produce the delay specified in the comment.</b><br/>
 A frequency independent delay loops needs to be implemented in the long term.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="leds-switches"></a>
LEDs and Switches</h3>
<p>The turning on and off of user interface LEDs occurs in the flash memory library to show memory activity. The switches are used to detect if read-only or read-write flash memory access over USB should be enabled. The following macros are defined in a custom file called "io.h":<br/>
 </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment"><span class="preprocessor">  #define     LED_GREEN_1_ON              PORTC.OUTSET = PIN4_bm</span>
<span class="preprocessor"></span><span class="preprocessor">  #define     LED_GREEN_1_OFF             PORTC.OUTCLR = PIN4_bm</span>
<span class="preprocessor"></span><span class="preprocessor">  #define     BUTTON_1_PRESSED            bit_is_clear(PORTA.IN, PIN4_bp)</span>
<span class="preprocessor">  #define     BUTTON_2_PRESSED            bit_is_clear(PORTD.IN, PIN4_bp)</span>
</pre></div><p> It is up to the user to define these macros as necessary.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="hardware"></a>
Hardware</h2>
<p>The basic hardware requirements are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>XMEGA Device with 2 free USARTs in SPI mode</li>
<li>MAX3420E on SPI interface</li>
<li>AT26 flash memory on SPI interface See reference design schematic and device datasheets for details.<br/>
 In the reference design Vbus detection is done with an onboard analog comparator. This is not however the only way of doing this. It is also possible to utilize the GPX pin of the MAX3420E which would need to be connected to the XMEGA and properly configured. See USB_SUSPEND and "MAX3420E Programming Guide" HOSCSTEN programming notes for more information.</li>
